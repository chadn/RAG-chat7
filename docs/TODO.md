# To Do

-   :white_check_mark: Use Together AI instead of OpenAI (they are compatible)
-   :white_check_mark: Enable save and restore by providing links to download and upload messages  
    BUG: must click download button twice to get latest json, can be fixed once "Deferred data" download button is released.
-   :white_check_mark: decouple chat model from functions.
-   :white_check_mark: create some pytest unit tests for functions, maybe for chat model
-   :white_check_mark: use `uv` and `pyproject.toml`
-   use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
-   use langchain instead of Together AI
-   use https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui instead of streamlit
